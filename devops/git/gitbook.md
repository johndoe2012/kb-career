One thing to watch out for: During the installation you will notice a window marked "Setup". Make sure you tick the "Add Python 3.6 to PATH" checkbox and click on "Install Now", as shown here:

<!--endsec-->

{% label %}myfile{% endlabel %}
```
$ python3 --version
Python 3.6.1
```

> **[info] Note:** 
> There are two underscore characters (`_`) between `title` and `contains`. Django's ORM uses this rule to separate field names ("title") and operations or filters ("contains"). If you use only one underscore, you'll get an error like "FieldError: Cannot resolve keyword title_contains".
